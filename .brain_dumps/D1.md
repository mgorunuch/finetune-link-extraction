Okay, what we know about from the Claude research there are some already predefined datasets for my case. I don't want to use predefined datasets; I want to create my own.

The main problem which people are facing is the context-aware thing - for example, "What does this button do?" or "What is it for?" In this case, it's hard to understand without some context around it (e.g., the HTML). We can do it like this: we have a headless browser which is headfull (it's not super important which one) running the code which marks all the content with the flag. After that, we extract all the links from this content with an appropriate context around it. It might be for example CSS classes on the parent elements, or maybe it is much more interesting information (from my knowledge, a lot of people use SEO for example).

It might be interesting to use tag names and in this case, we will dump what we have right now.

What do we have right now? Right now, we have basic flow. First, we run Credless browser. Second, we mark all the links we found with a tag. Third, we extract all the information using XPath or basic CSS selector and the words around siblings (e.g., we take the parent and the siblings to this element if the sibling siblings are present, it is okay).

Please note that this might be run without any browser just for HTML, but in headless and headfull mode, it is much easier to mark the content which contains the event listener.

Headless browser in this case (or headful browser) is needed only for cases to mark the content because we can do it like X-data ID, and in this case, we are able to statically analyze the content by AI.
