Research Prompt: Fine-Tuning Models for HTML Data Extraction
Investigate optimal approaches for fine-tuning large language models to extract structured data from HTML content. Focus on:

Methodologies for creating effective training datasets using HTML documents and desired extraction outputs
Comparison of zero-shot vs. fine-tuned model performance on HTML parsing tasks
Techniques to improve extraction accuracy for complex nested structures and diverse webpage layouts
Best practices for handling common challenges (dynamic content, inconsistent formatting, site-specific structures)
Quantitative benchmarks demonstrating extraction precision and recall improvements

Emphasize theoretical frameworks and empirical findings rather than implementation details.
