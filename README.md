# LLM Link Extraction Finetuning

A demonstration of finetuning large language models for precise URL extraction from text. (have never fine tunned the model before)

## Overview

This is a test project to evaluate how much time is needed to implement link extraction functionality from HTML pages.

This project shows how to finetune an open-source LLM to improve its ability to extract links from text while filtering out invalid or irrelevant content.

## Problem

Large language models often struggle with precise data extraction tasks, especially when dealing with structured data like URLs embedded in longer contexts.

## Solution

By finetuning an LLM specifically for link extraction, we can improve:
- Accuracy in identifying valid URLs
- Filtering out invalid or incomplete links
- Handling complex contexts with multiple links

## Usage

[Documentation on usage will be added as project develops]
