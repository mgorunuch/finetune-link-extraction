# Fine-tuning Implementation Plan for Link Extraction

## Objective
Develop a fine-tuned model specialized in extracting links with `data-x-action-id` attributes from HTML documents and outputting their IDs with appropriate action descriptions.

## Data Collection
- Gather HTML documents containing elements with `data-x-action-id` attributes
- Include diverse action types and contexts
- Ensure variety in action descriptions

## Data Preprocessing
- Parse HTML to identify elements with `data-x-action-id` attributes
- Extract the action IDs and contextual information
- Format training data in `<id>,action description` format
- Create comprehensive extraction examples

## Model Selection
- Base model: Language model capable of HTML parsing and structured extraction
- Fine-tuning focus: Extraction of action IDs and generation of concise descriptions

## Fine-tuning Process
1. Create training examples showing:
   - Input: HTML containing elements with `data-x-action-id` attributes
   - Output: `<id>,action description` for each action
2. Train model to:
   - Identify all elements with `data-x-action-id` attributes
   - Extract the action ID value
   - Generate clear, concise action descriptions based on context
   - Output in the specified `<id>,action description` format
3. Evaluate model performance on:
   - Identification of all action elements
   - Accuracy of ID extraction
   - Quality and relevance of action descriptions
   - Correct output formatting

## Success Metrics
- Complete extraction of all action IDs
- Descriptive and contextually accurate action descriptions
- Proper CSV formatting with `<id>,action description` structure
- Consistent extraction across varying HTML structures
